    This DDP communication hook runs allreduce to average gradients for the first K steps,

    This hook is designed to support post-local SGD, by running gradient averaging before local SGD stage.
    It is user's responsibility to perform model parameter averaging at local SGD stage after K steps.

    Args:
        state (AllReduceFirstKStepsState): State information to run allreduce for the first K steps.
        bucket (dist._GradBucket): Bucket that stores a 1D flattened gradient tensor that batches multiple per-variable tensors.

            only exactly one tensor is stored in this bucket.
